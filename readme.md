# TBLIS Bindings for Rust

This crate contains TBLIS FFI bindings.

[TBLIS](https://github.com/MatthewsResearchGroup/tblis) (Tensor BLIS, The Tensor-Based Library Instantiation Software) can perform various tensor operations (multiplication, addition, reduction, transposition, etc.) efficiently on single-node CPU. This library can be an underlying driver for performing einsum (Einstein summation).
